      <DIV>The legend of The Gods began many years ago&hellip;. They came from the world   before &mu;Tanks&hellip; the old world, one of renown men, the world of legends and   warriors&hellip; the world of &ldquo;Battlefield&rdquo;. They are the legends that fought colossal   raids and lived to tell about it. As the most feared and respected fighters from   the old world they were given a gift&hellip; the gift of immortality, making their   reign everlasting!&nbsp;<BR>
        <BR>
        As the most revered fighters of the old world, they   have now become the most feared fighting force in the new world, these legendary   warriors have become reincarnated in the world of &mu;Tanks as The Gods! Now on the   verge of chaos, The Gods have furthered their reign of destruction by taking   over the battlefield. Ruling it with an iron fist, striking down their foes and   crushing all who oppose them!<BR>
        <BR>
        They only show favor to those who are   worthy, those who play as they do, only to warriors who fight and die with   honor, regardless of the odds&hellip; The Gods are the elite. Get in their way and you   will surely see your own mortality in death. If you gain their respect, they   may&hellip; just may impart you with immortality to live among the legends, among the   ETERNAL.<BR>
        <BR>
        They are the ELITE, they are The Gods. You can run, but they   will catch you. You can hide, but they will find you. Say your prayers.<BR clear="all">
