                The legend of The Gods began many years ago&hellip;. They came
                from the world before &mu;Tanks&hellip; the old world, one of
                renown men, the world of legends and warriors&hellip; the world
                of &ldquo;Battlefield&rdquo;. They are the legends that fought
                colossal raids and lived to tell about it. As the most feared
                and respected fighters from the old world they were given a
                gift&hellip; the gift of immortality, making their reign
                everlasting!&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                As the most revered fighters of the old world, they have now
                become the most feared fighting force in the new world, these
                legendary warriors have become reincarnated in the world of
                &mu;Tanks as The Gods! Now on the verge of chaos, The Gods have
                furthered their reign of destruction by taking over the
                battlefield. Ruling it with an iron fist, striking down their
                foes and crushing all who oppose them!<br />
                <br />
                They only show favor to those who are worthy, those who play as
                they do, only to warriors who fight and die with honor,
                regardless of the odds&hellip; The Gods are the elite. Get in
                their way and you will surely see your own mortality in death.
                If you gain their respect, they may&hellip; just may impart you
                with immortality to live among the legends, among the
                ETERNAL.<br />
                <br />
                They are the ELITE, they are The Gods. You can run, but they
                will catch you. You can hide, but they will find you. Say your
                prayers.<br clear="all" />
