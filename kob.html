            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: hey, what's up vb, I'm sure you've been
              waiting impatiently for this moment to come, would you like to be
              interviewed for this week's update on uteams?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: lol i wouldn't say impatiently, but yes,
            that sounds fine ;p<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: proceed<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: how did you first come across utanks, what
              about the game pulled you in?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: well i was unaware that battlefield had
            been shut down when i had last checked up on it, i couldnt find it
            and it said bonus was some shitty merchanting website or something,
            i stumbled upon utanks on a search for battlefield from a forum.<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: there wasnt even a playable alpha and the
            website was mostly orange cones and coming soon signs, but there was
            a create your ccid option, so i did and was awarded with a ladybug
            on my first tank lol<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: so it's not exactly the game that pulled
            me in (since there was no game yet), but the hope for a battlefield
            reincarnation which i refound during the alpha testing phase<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: Aaravahn was the first tank i made that
            was awarded with the ladybug (which then became a bronze sot) then
            stripped during beta in prep for sot contest<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: oh nice, what maps do you play, and which
              is your favorate?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i play both maps and am on a team in both
            maps that even though i'm not very active on them, i am loyal to
            them and do want to shiner my team tanks someday<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: King of Blitz and Vulture are my main
            tanks, and my team tanks are Battlefield-99 and ApricoT JuicE, blitz
            is my favorite map by far though, sands hurts my eyes lol bright
            pixels<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: lol, i'm a huge fan of sands, all my swords
              happen to be in that map except for 1</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i only have one sword so far lol but close
            to shiner on vulture<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: do you know what's crazy? i had an eye exam
              last year for a new perscription of glasses around july, 3months
              before i started playing utanks and now about 9 months later i
              return to renew my perscription, but guess what, my eyes haven't
              gotten worse, in fact they're getting better, i dropped two levels
              for my perscription, isn't that wierd? its like white sands is the
              remedy my eyes needed lol</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: is your last name button lol? is it
            BEN?<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: lol, that's be awesome but no, i guess all
              the minicarrots i've been eating actually payoff ;\</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i like minicarrots<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: lol, anyways, how old are you?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i'm 21 currently, born december 26th 1990
            :) christmas baby, or boxing day for all the canadians >.><br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: lol, i take it you're canadian then?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i'm french-canadian by descent, but never
            lived in canada, beautiful country though i've visited it a few
            times, i love being up north<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: oh wait, you have a facebook, let me spy on
              that real fast hmmm</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: new jersey has WaWa's though, so it's a
            good life in dirty jersey<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: quite a few players actually live in
              jersey, i wonder, did battlefield have ads on tv for battlefield
              or something that boguht you all together?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: lol no, only players i know from jersey
            are sean987 and SPITFIRE, my boy robidude lives like 5 minutes from
            me though across the bridge to pennsylvania<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: haha nice! do you two hang out a lot?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: we knock over 7/11s every once and a while
            for kicks and make bank. we hang out a lot on runescape too lol he's
            a poor noob<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: what're your hobbies outside the
              game?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: what do you mean by outside?<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: lol jk, i like to hang out with my mom, go
            driving, i like working on cars (going to school to be an automotive
            technician) i like flirting with women both on and off the internet,
            shooting billiards, eating, hanging with friends<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: basic guy stuff really lol<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: comparing playbf to utanks, what're some
              things you like like about this new improved game?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i like the fact that i'm actually a
            respected player in utanks compared to how i played in battlefield,
            i know i wasn't good :| but can't blame a lowly site player for me,
            i still finished strong in crazy maze at #21<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i'm a far superior player in this game, it
            is a much better game than battlefield was playwise<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: what're some things you don't particularly
              like about utanks or could use improvement?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: the inactivity is really my only
            problem<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: improvements would be the additional
            reworking of my previously implimented mousewheel idea<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: of course i would like a purple heart,
            onyx sot, and war correspondant on KoB ;)<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: yeahh.. you sure are a funny one</span
            ><br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: if you could add one thing to the game to
              make it better, what would it be besides your mousewheel
              idea</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: ingame chat ability DEFINITELY<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: so aim wouldnt be needed and we can all
            still type WHILST we play :)<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: i agree, a lot of players have also held
              similar thoughts</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: of course the return of the mighty
            squirrelbots (but as long as they dont move all over your screen
            like they did in their testing ;) and maybe make the gameplay a
            little faster<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: but the speed as is is perfectly fine too
            :)<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: WE WANT CORBIN BACK<br />
            <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: LOL</span><br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: what would you take out of the game?<br
            /></span>
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: the 6 or 7 people currently ahead of me on
            the world top 10 ;p<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: but for real, i would take out two
            seperate maps and combine the stats to one new map (i'd vote
            uTopia)<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i believe that would bring back activity
            cause sands really did split the already small community we have :|
            and uTopia is a great looking map to represent the game<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: who would you say your favorite player in
              utanks would be?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: probably matooa or kacy, matooa has always
            been on my side for the most part and supported me becoming the
            player i am today, and kacy played rs with me sometimes and likes to
            skype and pph with me<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: i am waiting for more :l</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: and of course ben buttons<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: ben buttons-7<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: my bad<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: oh me?! i'm so touched thanks! :D </span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: lol:p<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: What is your overall goal that you wish to
              achieve from uTanks?</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i already have, i am the best blue in the
            game all trolling aside<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i want my desired awards though from my ug
            sig :c<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: can i have your wc?<br />
            <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: dream on sport</span><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: lol ok, but if you delete the tank
            transfer me it first :p<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: i'd rather transfer it to anaconda :l</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: :c<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: That's cold<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: lol, my prayers are still with you to win
              one! not since i still want to win one more ;-) </span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: :c!!!<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: i think i deserve a purple heart for my
            scrollwheel idea, that is a major improvement for the game play, idk
            if you use it<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: Well, i have to get going, thanks for your
              time for letting me interview you, good luck on the field
              soldier!</span
            ><br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: im sorry D:<br />
            <strong>Sherman</strong>: thanks, hope to see more players in my
            blitzkrieg :) i'm always ready to fight<br />
