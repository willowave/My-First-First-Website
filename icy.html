              ><strong>Ben</strong>: heyyyy, icy! would you mind letting me
              interview you today?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: That'd be great, thanks for the opportunity.
            :]<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: sweet! so how old are you?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: I'll be turning 23 in December.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: you sure are quite the grandpa haha</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: So it would seem. :-D <br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: what're favorite hobbies apart from the
              game?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Reading and writing are my main fortes. I love
            music, I get out to as many shows as possible. Specific hobbies, I
            love to skate, cook, make websites, build things, destroy things,
            spend time with friends. Normal stuff.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: cooking you say? what're some of the dishes
              you make?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: I make a mean chicken alfredo. That seems to
            be everybody's favorite. Love to make pasta also, that always goes
            over pretty well. Personally, nothing compares to a grilled cheese
            and some tomato soup. The simplest things seem to sate the largest
            appetites. <br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: haha, you're future wife is gunna love you
              ;p so anyways, how did you come across the game?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Some time after battlefield had been long
            gone, I came across utanks, or whatever they were calling it at the
            time. Still in very early development stages. It was choppy and
            goofy looking, but I could tell there was potential there. It struck
            my interest, and rekindled some long forgotten passion from my
            childhood. So I stuck around as the game progressed and evolved, and
            here we are today. I more or less watched and waited from step one,
            to where it is now. I'm very proud of what they've done with it.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: battlefield you say, wow its nice seeing
              all the vets return, what year did you begin playbf?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: That's a tough one. I found it in '99, played
            intermittently, didn't really get absorbed into it until about 2000.
            I'd quit for a year here and there, but something would always draw
            me back, a new tank, a new team. I played for most of the golden
            years of battlefield, I retired completely almost two years before
            the end.<br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Seems like eons ago.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: wow, nice, so what' do you love most when
              you're playing the game?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Raiding and tournaments. Not sure which I
            enjoy more. I've always loved the team dynamic though. I love the
            thrill of the hunt, having 7 of your bros chasing down some poor
            sap. I also love taking, nothing like a high panic situation. And
            tournaments, who doesn't love cups. I adore going 59 minutes in a
            legit tournament where it would seem it's going to be a pph contest,
            and then I snag the one and only kill for a cheap gold. The luck of
            the draw. Of course I do appreciate the pphing, but come on, it's
            all about the lucky shot, and that's been my recipe for success for
            nearly 20 cups here.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: haha, everyone does recognize your talent
              for tournies, so much that ppl commonly use the term "icying a
              tourny" ;p</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Which took a while to turn into a term of
            endearment. It was more a barb for a while there. But yeah, I'm
            known for that kind of playstyle. Others are known for the
            pointwork(Sean, Winter, etc).<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Different sides of the spectrum. :-) <br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: hey, whatever strategy works for you, then
              stick with it! as long as it's legit people really can't
              complain</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: There ya go. ;-) <br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: in your time playing utanks, what do you
              think your best memory of the game is?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: So many. When I first started Icy, I'd always
            tag the juices in sands. That was great to see a cohesive team in
            action. Later, when I joined the OPs, we'd have 10 people in and
            just shut the map down, that will always stick with me. Then of
            course there's smaller isolated incidences; When Kevin or Andy would
            come in a map and we'd all just immediately hop on them and kill
            them in record time. Any number of the massive debates we've had on
            the communal side of the game. Being on teamspeak with the boys,
            just shooting the shit. Lots of good times on utanks.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: i loved teamspeak as well, it really gave
              me a chance to bond more with ppl, but ppl eventually stopped
              using it because of the cheating that was going on in
              tournaments</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Nothing gold can stay, so they say. =/<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: haha. you must have a lot of tanks in
              utanks, which one would you think is your absolute favorite?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Definitely Icy. It's what I'm known for. I
            have a myriad of team tanks, all of which mean a good deal to me, of
            course. But Icy is my main tank, and my only "solo" tank. I have the
            first gold set in the game on that tank(the traditional gold award
            set from battlefield that everybody had, but nobody has in utanks
            for whatever reason), and hope to improve on it with an upgraded
            shield and maybe a war correspondent soon. Eventually I'll break
            back into the Top 10 in Sands on it, but not anytime soon. As with
            most other people's tanks right now, it just sits there as a
            treasure; a relic. Definitely my baby though.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: what teams have you been on in
              utanks?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Well of course I'm EPIC 1, but I never
            officially relaunched. Just a small band of us, but hey, it counts.
            I also was on the Special Operations, my OP being SUNRISE. Josh has
            asked me to rejoin recently, and with final release nearing, there
            may be a resurgence there. I'm also on the Skillz as UnScReWeD
            SkiLLz, one of the few active teams to this day. We mostly just mob
            around blitz with the battlefields and the random mass of reds, but
            that's about all anybody has these days, still a cohesive unit and a
            good group of lads. I'm happy to have all the comrades I do, from
            all three units. :]<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: I told the snakes NO.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Just thought I'd add that.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Big red letters; N O.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Though Allen did once bribe me with a Jeep to
            join. Long story.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: LOL<br />

              <strong>Ben</strong>: What teams do you have the most respect for
              in uTanks other than the teams you have been on?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: The Juices were an integral part of my
            formative experience in Sands, and Jeff and the rest of them have my
            utmost respect for that. Naturally the Perfections as well. I've
            spent a good 30 hours battling them with the OPs, back in the day.
            And the Battlefields of course, never been without a battle in Blitz
            when I wanted one. Good guys all around.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: What is your favorite map in utanks, what
              sets it apart from the other?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: I don't have a favorite per se. I chose to put
            my main tank in Sands simply because at the time Blitz was already
            so congested with tanks and points, climbing up would have tooken
            twice as long. So now I'm naturally a bit biased towards Sands, if I
            had to pick. I like the scarcity of fuel and open land. Lots of
            movement, lots of tracking. Blitz is fun for it's own reasons of
            course. Tons of open land and water to facilitate massive team
            battles, and the green is a lot easier on the eyes than bright
            yellow when you're putting in hundreds of hours.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: i guess we all have our opinions, sands
              speaks to me from the heart haha<br />
              <strong>Ben</strong>: what're some of your treasured memories with
              your team, events and raids in particular</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: There would be nights when there would be
            seemingly 10 of each OP, Juice, and Perf in, and we'd just rotate
            raids around the map. Each corner you'd see a different mass of
            color chasing one solitary member down. Specifically, I remember one
            take on SUNRISE where there were about 8 reds on me, and the map was
            almost empty, and they had me on the ropes on the far left side of
            the map, and they started to get careless. Between my scrambling and
            quick teles for fuel, the thrill of the chase seemed to make them
            unweary of any threat. So I filled my shields and decided to throw
            'em on and sit there while they all landed and got a shot or two in.
            I was quickly scanning for any of them who were dangerously low.
            That's when I caught Voodoo slipping, and fired two off and killed
            him for a star rank. And then proceeded to empty duals and finish
            the raid. Probably my favorite take ever. As for giving, that's
            countless. I would love raiding any opposing team leader. They know
            it's high pressure, you know it's high pressure, there's reputation
            riding on it. It's immediately a fevered battle anytime it happens.
            God knows Jeff and Sean have tooken a fair number of OP raids. Lots
            of those count as favorites.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: voodoo you say? i think that was during my
              first 1-2weeks on utanks haha, almost tempted to edit that art out
              ;p</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: I imagine you remember that. =p<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Yeah it was some time ago. I didn't want to
            pinpoint you in your own interview, but I mean, you know that was
            hilarious XD<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: haha, i just just kidding<br />

              <strong>Ben</strong>: did being on a team help you learn and
              attach yourself to the game better?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Not originally. When I joined the OPs they
            were in a state of discord already. I really only got close to Josh
            and one or two others. I was already well learned in the game but
            there wasn't much room to make friends or benefit from anybody
            there. They were already drawing to their end. Still, it did teach
            me things. It taught me how to better handle things in times of
            duress. And literally, no denying it, I learned a lot on the raiding
            dynamics, and playing with honor. Good team to have been on. And the
            Skillz, I try to impart what I can to the newer members. These days
            our activity is sporadic and random. It's a good thing to be able to
            call 5 of your boys in whenever and get Blitz active. That
            definitely made me feel closer to the game in a time when it's not
            so active.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: comparing playbf to utanks, what're some
              things you like like about this new improved game?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: As everybody says, the faster pace. I can't
            even begin to tolerate the old speed. The graphics are a major bonus
            of course, everything is much crisper and prettier. And the direct
            presence of the developers, you can always get ahold of Andy or
            Kevin if you need to, it really makes you feel like what you're
            doing actually matters. All great improvements.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: can you think of any reasons why some
              players might prefer tankpit over utanks?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: No. That shit is gay. Lol<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Well, Seriously, I can understand some of it.
            There is the nostalgia of course. It's got to be beautiful for some
            people to see the direct replica of battlefield right there for them
            to play. Also, there's a large memberbase, albeit mostly newbs and
            randoms. There seems to be constant activity on the map. Short of
            that, no, not really. Whilst I am heavily biased to utanks, it
            honestly is a much better game.<br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: If I had the choice between uTanks and
            Battlefield, I'd still pick uTanks. Even though tp IS bf, you know
            what I mean.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: yeah i do, what're some things you don't
              particularly like or could use improvement?<br />
              <strong>Ben</strong>: utanks that is</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: It's nearly perfect as it stands,
            aesthetically. More or less anything that would actually boost
            activity would be ideal. But that's a long road with a lot of bends
            to start down right now. In general, more tournaments, slightly
            faster game play(I know people think it's fast as it is, but if you
            recall, recently I asked Kevin to speed it up just for a little bit
            so we could try it, and he actually did it, and it played very
            well.), definitely a new map, and other smaller nuggets, which I
            won't mention, because I'm saving them to suggest them myself,
            because I'm greedy and want awards like that lol. But yeah, small
            things here and there. Primarily we just need activity back. That's
            our main goal.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: how do you feel about the current state of
              advertising in utanks? what could you suggest would help with that
              matter?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Currently there isn't much need for it.
            Assuming final release comes, then yeah, we start. Guerilla
            advertising, word of mouth, google, other gaming communities, simple
            things. The way I see it, we could invest thousands of dollars into
            search engines and legitimate advertising, and only so many people
            are going to want to play a 2D tank game. That's it. That's the
            reality of it. These games we play look like super nintendo games
            and people think they're retarded, and I don't blame them. Be that
            as it may, we need to advertise to the players we already have, get
            them back. Because we can recruit a million new people, but what's
            the longevity there? How long 'til they get tired of it and move on?
            We have that trouble with dedicated people who have been playing
            battlefield for 10 years and actually have something vested here.
            There just isn't a huge market for this type of game. I think it's
            more prudent to retain the memberbase we have, and do what we can to
            keep it thriving and happy.<br />

              ><strong>Ben</strong>: how do you feel about the community as a
              whole, i know there is mixed feelings especially when it comes to
              teams and tournaments</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Our community is shit. Battlefield died
            because of it. Not because they went bankrupt. Battlefield was dead
            long before the game itself shut down. We've always been a community
            of assholes. There is a definite air of hostility outside of the
            game, and it permeates into basically every aspect of utanks. It
            seems on the forums, and in the chats, people are just waiting to
            correct somebody, or belittle somebody, or make themselves look
            good. That, plus the egos, my god. The peacocking in our community
            is insane. I've never seen anybody strive so hard for a 10x10 pixel
            award, or a few likes on a post. But most of the time, it's for
            neither. Most of the time people seem to just be hostile to be
            hostile. Back in the day, it was understandable. We were hormonal
            teenage boys. Now most of us are in our 20's and 30's, and we can't
            get stuck in the middle school drama bullshit again. Everybody needs
            to chill out and appreciate eachother as brothers. Because I don't
            know anybody else who plays this silly ass game.<br />

              ><strong>Ben</strong>: explains our 'plentiful' female population
              in this game</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: If our spouses knew how we acted online,
            they'd leave us in a heartbeat.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Don't let your wives find you on here. Word to
            the wise.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: LOL i'm with you on that<br />
              <strong>Ben</strong>: if you could add one thing to the game to
              make it better, what would it be?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: A war correspondent on Icy.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: Or maybe an in-game chat, or raid bonus
            counter.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: =P<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: ah, that's what i loved about playbf, the
              x5 program included an awesome chatroom below the client, i think
              there talk in the works about the same happening for the final
              release as well</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: It'd eliminate a lot of the drama. It'd funnel
            everything into mostly game-orientated chat.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: spitfire, bought up the raid bonus counter
              idea, i'm in full support, chris deserves a lightbulb for that if
              they existed in this game</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Another thing that baffles me. We need
            bulbs.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: YES! i know! that award would continuously
              motivate players to submit more ideas to help the game out, but
              just the same, people should feel inclined to help because they
              want to, not because they have to</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Indeed. Such a simple thing to not have.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: what would you take out of this game?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Can't really think of anything I'd remove. A
            lot of it has already been fixed. I'd remove long moves, map delay,
            etc. Small things like that. Beacons I suppose. I don't think I've
            ever used one lol.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: likewise, i almost NEVER use beacons unless
              i'm raiding a marathoner then by god give me 50 beacons</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Right lol<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: What is your overall goal that you wish to
              achieve from uTanks?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: I'd like to get back into the top 10 in sands.
            Get gold shield and WC on Icy. Eventually restart the EPICs in full
            swing. Little personal things. Ultimately, I just want to see the
            game active and the players happy again. I'd do whatever it takes to
            achieve that.<br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: ditto<br />
              <strong>Ben</strong>: who would you say your favorite player in
              utanks would be?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: That's a tough one. Nobody has really extended
            themselves to me on a personal level for me to become enamored with
            them. And likewise I consider myself one of the original battlefield
            legends, modesty aside, so I'm not really starstruck by anybody. I
            was alone for most of my utanks endeavor. I do have some favorites
            though. Josh of course for letting me onto the ops, Jeff for him and
            his juices being my respite from the mobs when I was a lowly lone
            purple, then of course a myriad of other people; Term, Ruthless,
            Sherman, Okisme(for being an annoying little bastard every day and
            motivating me to be way better than him), and some other people I'm
            not going to mention, but you know who you are.<br />
            <strong>Icy</strong>: And you of course, you've always been clever
            and highly motivated, trying to keep the scene alive. Gotta love the
            uteams site also. <br />

            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: ahh, it's always nice being the interviewer
              :-) ppl probably feel more pressured to include me when i ask this
              question xD</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Nah, I'm heartless, I don't care to appease
            people lol. I've always liked you. :-)<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: hehe, ty :-)<br />
              <strong>Ben</strong>: and as we close, what are some brief tips
              that you can give to any new players that read this
              interview?</span
            ><br />

            <strong>Icy</strong>: Enjoy the game. Learn from other players.
            Don't indulge in the petty dramas. Remember; don't open your mouth
            unless what you're about to say is more beautiful than silence. And
            most importantly? Get low.<br />
            <span id="drange"
              ><strong>Ben</strong>: thanks for your time letting me interview
              you, best of luck out on the field!</span
