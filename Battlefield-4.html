  <p><span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: hey, thanks for letting me interview you, shall we get started?</span><br>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: yeah<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: So exactly how old are you?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: 21<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: haha i see, do you go to school or have a job outside the game?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I hope to start school around the beginning of next year.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: oh, very nice<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I work homecare with my stepdad for now though<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: how did you come across the game?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I played quite a bit of the original Battlefield when i was really young. A friend my dad worked with showed it to him and then me and my brother started playing. My dads tank was CARDINAL, his friend was vol, my brother was killerk, and i was TwiSteR. <br>
    found uTanks through one of the old forums i believe<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: oh really? what year exactly do you think you began battlefield?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Wayyy back in like 98-99<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: haha, i see, so you're pretty much a vet<br>
      what do you love most about playing the game?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: My favorite aspect of the game is raiding/taking raids. Such a rush when youre hanging on by a thread with 7+ tanks on you.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: i know what you mean, do any raids stick out to you in particular?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I could name many lol, but yeah i have one in particular.<br>
    KiD sTeeL was the tank i was playing, i was doing really well and jeff(matooa2) was apart of the raid.<br>
    i made a pinpoint tele to a ferry with fuel on it with no shields and 1 dual shot till death, i was laughing so hard and jeff was in amaze lol<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: just like something i'd expect from the beast ;p<br>
      What is your favorite tank in uTanks, what makes it so special?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Envy is my pride and joy. I have always loved the name and I really like how blue sets on the sand tiles.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: oh really? what about battlefield-4, there has been a ton of stories about all the raids you've taken on it, not to mention being #1 general in the world haha<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Of course Bf-4 <br>
    I managed to achieve my dream awards on it, working on the golden sword to complete it. and i like defending my #1 spot, but being #1 does get a bit old!<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: i bet it does, but yet you've found the motivation to keep playing, somethingmost players can't do, what is your trick?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I will admit 500-1000 is a pretty steap climb for the last sword.<br>
    I do lose interest and disappear from the game from time to time lol<br>
    Just something about leaving a goal unfinished brings me back<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: do you think someone will ever pass bf-4, do YOU want it to happen?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Well I don't plan on playing forever so it could happen and as long as the person that does pass me is a role model player then im fine with it.<br>
    I try to set an example being the #1 tank on the field.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: do you think this game has made a good/bad impact on your life,and how?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: It has taken alot of time away from me, this is true. But i enjoy playing.<br>
    I never put it before important things though.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: very good, always know your limits<br>
      did you get anything from it that you can use to help guide your daily life?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I have always been one to set goals and achieve them so I suppose thats a good asset to apply to life.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: glad to see you are taking the educational approach to this game at least haha<br>
      What teams do you have the most respect for in uTanks other than the teams you have been on?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: The juices are a great team, i was on the team for a day but decided to quit because i was already working on a few tanks.<br>
    Even through all of the arguments with the OPz i still liked seeing them in white sands.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: ah i see, and did being on a team help you learn and attach yourself to the game better?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Being on a team definitely brings you closer to the community and helps influence playing the &quot;right&quot; way<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: what're some of your treasured memories with your team, events and raids in particular<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Being on a team with some of the best players the game has seen there has been alot of good times.<br>
    Running the snakes out of the map when outnumbered was always a good laugh<br>
    Seeing my teammates get swords, winning cups and being awarded those special awards is great aswell<br>
    Building things with obbys with kylemac was a blast haha, making huge bases with jordanp<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: i bet, kyle was always one of the more funner players to hang out with<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: indeed he was<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: comparing playbf to utanks, what're some things you like like about this new improved game?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I like how the screen is alot bigger. I wish they had of made the actual map a bit bigger to compensate though.<br>
    The game runs alot faster paced which i like<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: agreed, the speed is still being debated, some hope it to get faster, some even slower<br>
      what're some things you don't particularly like or could use improvement?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: There really isnt anything that just bugs me.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: ah, that's a good sign at least<br>
      if you could add one thing to the game to make it better, what would it be?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I really liked the idea me Josh and a few others talked about<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: the overhead map numbers right? i loved that idea as well<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Adding a number over your tank to show if its true top 10<br>
    I think top players should be recognized even when not a general.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: yes, yes i completely agree!<br>
      what would you take out from this game?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: BEACONS<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: haha why so?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: a good raider shouldnt need to use a beacon when staying on target<br>
    takes away skill<br>
    I do not use them.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: i hear ya, what're your thoughts about beacons being used in tournaments?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Tournaments are usually hectic. I can see beacons being useful there.<br>
    Targetting someone you know is a good ppher could be a plus.<br>
    or targetting that newb you know is going to die. but like i said i dont use them. <br>
    Battlefield didnt have them and we did just fine back then.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: i like your thinking, vets usually provide better input because of their experience<br>
      </span>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: What is your overall goal that you wish to achieve from uTanks?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: To enjoy the game and set an example to newer players.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: yes, perfect mind set, newer players need a good role model to look up to<br>
      </span>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: looking back on your time with this game, who would you say are some of your favorate player(s)?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I'll try to keep this list short lol<br>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Kylemac for being a monster raid taker, Jordan for being a great team leader, zub for being zub, cujo for being a beast all around, matooa2 for being all around good player and person, ben for giving me lolz when i kill him 1v1<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: glad i'm on the list at least :l<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: hey youve got me a few times too hah<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: 8)<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: theres many more people im leaving out. sherman for being a splinter to the snakes, Josh/DESERT STORM for everything hes done for the game and always tryin his best, Sean987 for taking control of tournaments and providing endless laughs in perf chat<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: and finally, What are some brief tips that you can give to any new players that read this interview?<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: Take advice from veterans. Take every raid that's thrown at you. Practice makes perfect. Never go into a raid expecting to live.<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: a wonderful tip, i hope'll be quoted one day. well, thanks for taking the time to let me interview you kacy, best of luck out the on the field<br>
      </span>
    <strong>Kacy</strong>: I'll see you in sands later =d<br>
    <span id="drange"><strong>Ben</strong>: lol</span></p>
