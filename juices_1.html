              >It all began over 10 years ago when 4 Battlefield greats decided
              to start a new badass secret team. As one of the original Desert
              teams, they stormed onto the scene and made an immediate impact.
              Within a month, co-founder madmike AKA LemoN JuicE had shinered
              and broken into the year old Desert top ten. Tournaments almost
              always featured a JuicE, usually a JuicE cup at that, and within a
              month they had swept all 3 cups from a single tournament which was
              a very rare occurance for a team to do, especially at this point
              in time. After only a few months of activity, an interview was
              requested from the Legendary JoeBeta. One of the original founders
              gave it
              <a

                >here</a
              >. Within a year or so's time the team started to die out as a lot
              of the original members, founders included, became very inactive
              in the game itself.</font

              >Over 6 years later, in November 2007, two original founders in
              crusher and Viper Katzman teamed up with Crazy Maze legend ZuB
              zEr0 to ressurect the team. Desert had died off a bit at the time
              with not very many active teams. The Special Operations were
              around of course, but weren't too active as there wasn't much
              competition from rival teams. </font

              As we made our presence felt on the field, the OPz slowly returned
              to the sand pit to bring the fight to us. We had many fun-filled
              memorable battles with them that will not be forgotten. Just over
              2 months into our return we pull off the rare triple shiner as
              ApplE, CarroT, and LemoN all shiny up together:</font

              of our existence, we are secret team that tries to stay out of
              forum drama. As with all secret teams, members will slowly be
              revealed over time for one reason or another. We aim to let our
              play on the field speak for itself. We play legitimate, take every
              raid thrown at us, and don't belittle others for their poor
              playing styles, as we feel it speaks for itself. We look forward
              to seeing you all on the battlefield.</font
