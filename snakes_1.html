Whether it is the way that they move or those stark, unblinking eyes, they just seem to represent the absolute definition of everything that is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.&quot;</font></div></td>

The team's creation stemmed from the break-up of the Dynasty team in 2001 during the days of Battlefield.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During this time the -SnakeS- lasted through years of Battlefield enduring leadership changes due to BBC3 and -AnacondA-'s retirement.  -VipeR- took the team over in 2003 and did a phenomenal job leading the team into battle against the most known team at the time, STRIKES led by falon.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the days of Battlefield came to an end so did the -SnakeS-.  Recently, the -SnakeS- were brought back at the end of August 2011 by the original -AnacondA- and -VipeR- on uTanks.  Due to -AnacondA-'s detrimental choices the team nearly fell apart; as a result, -AnacondA- retired his tank as it was permanently deleted and banned.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-VipeR- and -Death addeR- rose to the occasion to keep the team together, and have turned the team around in a new, great positive direction.  We the -SnakeS- have many plans for the future and hope to build a legacy.  See you all on the field!</font>

  <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also hope to keep this game active as we have done so far.  As of right now, we are very satisfied with the progress this team has made.  The leaders of the -SnakeS- have much bigger plans once final release is out!</font></div></td>
